# WoT Farm Simulator
This project is a simple simulation of a digital farm. It can be used as a playground to understand how the Web Of Thing works.

## RoadMap 
- Fronted:
    - [x] first rendering of the farm
    - [x] Modify the base 3d model of the farm to be more "usable"
    - [x] Skybox rendering
    - [x] connect fronted with the simulated web things
    - [ ] add animations
    - [x] add a code editor to write user defined scripts
    - [ ] add interface for user private simulations
- Backend
    - [ ] Add unit tests
    - [X] Basic terrain simulation
    - [ ] Add a discovery service
    - [ ] Create user private simulations
    - [ ] save simulation state
    - [ ] Weather service
    - [ ] Advanced terrain simulation

## Terrain simulation

Currently, the terrain simulation is based on the `sech` function. The simulation modifies `sech` parameters to emulate watering and evaporation. Future development might involve a better spread on Z axis and the introduction of soil parameters.
Here it is a simple simulation of the soil water content after two irrigation events:
